# Sea Level Predictor
 The fifth and final certification project for the [Data Analysis with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/) course on the [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/) platform.

 This project aims to accomplish the following tasks (with additional personal insights):
 - Using Matplotlib, create a scatter plot using the *Year* column as the x-axis and the *CSIRO Adjusted Sea Level* column as the y-axis.
- Use the linregress function from scipy.stats to get the slope and y-intercept of the line of best fit.
  - Plot the line of best fit over the top of the scatter plot.
  - Make the line go through the year 2050 to predict the sea level rise in 2050.
- Plot a new line of best fit just using the data from year 2000 through the most recent year in the dataset.
  - Make the line also go through the year 2050 to predict the sea level rise in 2050 if the rate of rise continues as it has since the year 2000.
- The x label should be *Year*, the y label should be *Sea Level (inches)*, and the title should be *"Rise in Sea Level"*.
